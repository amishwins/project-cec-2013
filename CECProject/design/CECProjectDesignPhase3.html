		<h2>Architecture and Design</h2>
		
		<p>Phase 3 presented us with some new requirements to complement our already <b><i>robust</i></b> 
		email and meeting client:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Send email through network
				<ul>
					<li>Test with at least 3 clients</li>
					<li>Verify that filters are applied on each client</li>
					<li>Robustness (if user is logged off when email is sent)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Invite another person to a meeting
				<ul>
					<li>Target person receives email invitation</li>
					<li>Target person can accept or decline</li>
					<li>"Edit over the network" (See next requirement)</li>
				</ul>			
			</li>
			<li>Concurrently edit an appointment
				<ul>
					<li>Allow two instances of your program to edit over the network</li>
					<li>Optimistic locking</li>
					<li>Basic merge / conflict resolution</li>
				</ul>			
			</li>
		</ol>
		
	
		
		<h3>N-Tiers and Package Structure</h3>		
		<p>We enhanced the package structure to include a new Network package, whose responsibility
		was to handle all communication between client/server.</p>

		<h3>Major Additions and Changes to Classes</h3>
		
		<p><b>Network Classes</b></p>
		<p>Server classes</p>
		<ul>
			<li>SuperCECServer: This class represents our server. It encapsulates and hides the complexity for handling
			sockets, and input/output streams. Upon launch, it submits three main tasks to a thread pool which it also
			encapsulates (ExecutorService). 
				<ul>
					<li><b>ServerClientAcceptor (long running)</b>: this task is responsible for listening on the Server Socket which the 
					server instantiates. Each time a client connects, it spawns a new task: ServerThreadPerClient. 
					This task handles each individual client connection to the server - socket, streams, email address,
					sending/receiving from the server to the target client. </li>
					<li><b>EmailListenerCECServer (long running)</b>: the ServerThreadPerClient task puts emails which it receives on a 
					a LinkedBlockingDeque owned by the SuperCECServer. This shared data is concurrently accessed by 
					the EmailListenerCECServer task which takes care of getting the right output stream and sending
					that email to the target recipient. </li>
					<li><b>SendPendingMessages (one shot)</b>: in the event that a user had registered with the server, and is now
					currently offline and receives an email, this thread is tasked with trying to send all un-received
					emails to that person upon his reconnection. It is triggered from the ServerClientAcceptor.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
			<li>All data structures owned by the SuperCECServer used to manage the concurrency. It was smarter to create
			new thread-safe library-managed collections and then use the ExecutorService than trying to hand-code the 
			wait/notify or even more low-level lock/unlock. We might be able to squash some of these
			collections together by merging some objects; however, we don't have a compelling reason yet. <br><br>
				<img src="SuperCECServerDataStructures.png" border=0></img><br><br>
				
			</li>
			
			<li>The Server main() code is very simple as shown here: <br><br>
				<img src="SuperCECServerMainMethod.png" border=0></img><br><br>
			</li>
			
			<li> The handshake between the client and the server looks something like this (used http://www.websequencediagrams.com/): 
			<br><br>
			<img src="handshake.png"></img><br></li>
		
		</ul>		
		<p>The overall set of classes which communicate on the server side are shown here:</p>
		<p><a href="networkserverclasses.png"><img src="networkserverclasses.png" width=800 border=0></img></a></p>
		
		<p>Client Network Classes</p>
		<ul>
			<li>NetworkHelper: used to initially connect to the server (see handshake sequence diagram above). Its other
			responsibilities are to send emails, meeting requests, and meeting updates. It manages its own local thread
			pool, on which it adds the task to listen for messages from server.  </li>
			<li>ListenerForMessagesFromServer (long running): the server can send different types of objects - emails, acknowledgement 
			of receiving something, and meeting change sets. This task is responsible for listening and responding 
			correctly to each of the kinds of objects it can receive. </li>
			<li>UpdateEmailClientView: a simple one-shot thread which is called whenever a client receives an email to
			nicely update his inbox.</li>
			<li><a href="networkclientclasses.png"><img src="networkclientclasses.png" border=0></img></a><br></li>
		</ul>
		<br><br>
		
		<p>Communication Change Set (CCS)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The CCS was used to communicate differences to the server when a client updated a meeting after it had already
			been sent and received by the server.</li>
			<li>A <b>Change </b>object contains the before and after values for a field. Each change the user makes is stored
			in a CCS object as shown below. The CCS can take one one of a few states (ACCEPT, DECLINE, CHANGE, CHANGE_ACCEPTED,
			and CHANGE_REJECTED). These states were used to communicate between client and server on the type of operation
			which was being sent. </li>
			<li>This change set was the main form of communication between client and server to enable two clients to 
			simultaneously edit an appointment over the network, and relied on a few system invariants (mostly discussed 
			below), such as the fact that the meeting after being sent is OWNED by the server.  <br><br></li>

		</ul>
		
		<h2>Important Decisions</h2>

		<h3>Testing and Confidence</h3>
		<p>Problem: How to test our code, for all threading / concurrency and serialization?</p>
		<p>Solution: We found it quite difficult to approach this phase with the same strategy for unit testing as we did 
		in the first two phases. There were no real "domain" entities, and most of the code added was related to handling 
		communication over the network. Thus the approach we adopted was to strengthen our use of the logger, especially
		in all the network classes. This proved very useful when testing - somebody sitting at the server console
		would literally see everything that was being sent through - almost like watching the code in The Matrix!
		While this was no where near as effective (since we needed to first start up the clients, launch the server,
		connect to the server, and then actually run the tests), good concise and precise logging paid off in many
		situations. </p>
		
		<p>Some unit tests were still created to help test the CommunicationChangeSet (the object responsible for capturing
		changes to a meeting), and Change (the object contained within a change set). </p> 
		
		<h3>Serializing Email, Meeting, Acknowledgement, CommunicationChangeSet</h3>
		<p>Problem: How to send data across the wire to CEC clients connected to the server?</p>
		<p>Solution: We leveraged the Serializable interface provided by the standard java.io package. All of these objects 
		were quite simple: their logical and physical forms matched quite nicely, so we used the default serialized form 
		instead of creating our own custom ones. </p>  
		
		<h3>Connecting, Offline, Online</h3>
		<p>Problem: How to deal with clients who connect, and then disconnect?</p>
		<p>Solution: At first, it was a real challenge - we encountered countless "stream corruption" exceptions. We needed
		a better strategy to deal with the different connection possibilities, and to act accordingly. Many sites online 
		had references to the fact that a lot of socket methods were unreliable, thus we decided to opt for a simple, clean
		and efficient design. The idea is that upon connecting, the SuperCECServer stored a link between the client's 
		registration email, his socket, and the input and output streams. Whenever a client with the same email "reconnected"
		we simply overwrote those mappings. We understand that in a real scenario, this poses a security check; however,
		this is out of scope for this phase and thus we deemed it an appropriate solution. </p>  
		
		
		<h3>Concurrency Techniques</h3>
		<p>Problem: How to manage access to shared resources, especially when an arbitrary number of threads can access? Also, 
		how to manage the threads and providing Runnables to be executed?</p>
		<p>Solution: here we leaned heavily on the well tested and documented thread pool abstraction: Executor Service. This
		class provided the thread-safety, thread-management, and orchestration necessary to successfully build a multi-client
		email program, which allows optimistic changes to shared data. We had numerous amount of threads:</p>
		<b>Long running (meaning when spawned, keeps running until the application closes or some other even occurs):</b>
		<ul>
			<li>ServerClientAcceptor</li>
			<li>ServerThreadPerClient</li>
			<li>EmailListenerCECServer</li>
			<li>SentEMailCleanupThread (handle acknowledgements)</li>
			<li>ServerClientAcceptor</li>
			<li>ListenerForMessagesFromServer</li>
		</ul>
		<b>One shot(meaning when spawned, runs for the data its given and then completes):</b>
		<ul>
			<li>ChangeSetThreadForMeetings</li>
			<li>SendPendingMessages (in case a client reconnects, to send him his messages)</li>
			<li>UpdateEmailClientView (to actually refresh the Inbox if the user is on that view)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Thus for the most part, it made sense to communicate with our SuperCECServer and submit these tasks to the 
		main Executor.</p>  
		
		
		
		<h3>Concurrent Editing of a Meeting</h3>
		<p>Problem: How to be able to concurrently edit a meeting on the network? </p>
		<p>Solution: We simplified our design with the following decision: as soon as the client sends a meeting to the server,
		the client is no longer the owner of the meeting and it now is a shared document which belongs to the server. All
		subsequent updates need to go through the server, and this alleviates the need for clients to know about other
		clients (in a peer-to-peer fashion). This allowed us to make some important decisions regarding the Change Set -
		most notably: if a client tries to update a meeting, if his original copy does not match the servers, then he needs
		to perform an update. This led to the design of the Change object (see above). </p>  
		<p>One major challenge with this was how to address the issue of what happens when a client tries to update, but 
		is not in sync. We decided that the best approach was to mimic SVN - during the update, lock the UI. If the update 
		is successful, simply close the window. If the update was rejected, then give a message to the user that some fields
		need to be merged, and prevent the system from saving the meeting on his local client. This proved challenging from
		an implementation perspective, and also from a correctness perspective - is it good practice to lock the main AWT 
		thread? Regardless, we followed this approach and included some basic usability: log that we're waiting for a response 
		every 100ms, and upon reception, unlock the main UI thread. If the server doesn't respond in 3 seconds, then
		we tell the user that something is wrong with the server and to try later. The code in the NetworkHelper (client 
		side) which runs is shown here: </p>

		<h3>Merger Classes - Server CCS Merge and Client CCS Merge</h3>
		<p>Problem: How to intelligently take changes to a meeting and apply them (also intelligently)</p>
		<p>Solution: Due to time constraints, we were not able to fully realize a merge algorithm strategy based on different
		fields. We did however plan for it by designing a Merger interface, and creating the shells for some basic merge classes 
		(BodyMerger, SimpleTextFieldMerger). Thus for the purposes of the phase 3 release schedule, we simply send back
		any conflicts to the client, and ask him to resolve it. </p>  
		
				
		<h2>Reused Libraries / Code Inspiration (in addition to Phase 1)</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>StringTokenizer: Tokenizer to help with removing spaces and email address parsing
			(java.util.StringTokenizer)</li>
			<li>SrtringUtils: Apache Commons Language StringUtils to help with counting the number 
			of occurrences of a certain character within a string (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils)</li>
			<li>Cleanup convenience methods as provided by Troy in lecture code</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h2>Design Patterns (extensions and applications from Phase 1)</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Builder: cec.model.EmailBuilder, cec.model.MeetingBuilder</li>
			<li>Factory: cec.model.FolderFactory, cec.persistence.EmailDaoFactory, 
			cec.persistence.FolderDaoFactory, cec.model.RuleSetFactory, cec.persistence.RuleDaoFactory,
			cec.persistence.MeetingDaoFactory, cec.persistence.TemplateDaoFactory  </li>
			<li>Adapter/Wrapper: cec.view.Email, cec.view.EmailClient</li>
			<li>Facade: cec.persistence.EmailXMLDao, cec.persistence.FolderXMLDao (for the javax.xml.parser,
			javax.xml.transform, apache.commons.io, and w3c.dom classes)</li>
			<li>Observer: cec.view.EmailClient (TreeSelectionListener), JTable for emails listens to 
			model changes when an email is send, saved, or deleted., all JTextComponents on which InputMaps
			and ActionMaps were defined.  
			</li>
			<li>Singleton: cec.view.EmailClient</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>OOD Honorable Mentions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Value object: cec.view.EmailViewEntity</li>
			<li>Data Access Object (DAO) interfaces: cec.persistence.EmailDao, cec.persistence.FolderDao</li>
			<li>Test Patterns: 
				<ul>
					<li>Stub objects: isolated model tests by injecting/stubbing dependencies to persistence</li>
					<li>Integration: a few more-involved integration tests were written, on the back
					bone one solid unit tests</li>
				</ul>
			</li>	
		
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Known Issues</h2>
		<h3>Meeting Edge Cases</h3>
		<p>Because of how meetings are edited concurrently over the network, we have disabled a somewhat 
		expected feature: distribution. We felt it was more important to handle the change sets on the server,
		and completed this implementation; however, we don't have a solid strategy to "notify" all members 
		of this shared document, that changes were made.</p> 

		<h3>Merging</h3>
		<p>We wanted to try and implement a more comprehensive merge algorithm, but due to time constraints 
		we were unable to fully realize it. We have positioned the code to use the proper merge algorithm 
		strategy, however, those classes are simply placeholder for now. </p>
