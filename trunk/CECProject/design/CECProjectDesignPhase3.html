		<h2>Architecture and Design</h2>
		
		<p>Phase 3 presented us with some new requirements to complement our already <b><i>robust</i></b> 
		email and meeting client:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Send email through network
				<ul>
					<li>Test with at least 3 clients</li>
					<li>Verify that filters are applied on each client</li>
					<li>Robustness (if user is logged off when email is sent)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Invite another person to a meeting
				<ul>
					<li>Target person receives email invitation</li>
					<li>Target person can accept or decline</li>
					<li>"Edit over the network" (See next requirement)</li>
				</ul>			
			</li>
			<li>Concurrently edit an appointment
				<ul>
					<li>Allow two instances of your program to edit over the network</li>
					<li>Optimistic locking</li>
					<li>Basic merge / conflict resolution</li>
				</ul>			
			</li>
		</ol>
		
	
		
		<h3>N-Tiers and Package Structure</h3>		
		<p>We enhanced the package structure to include a new Network package, whose responsibility
		was to handle all communication between client/server.</p>
		<p><a href="PackageLayoutPhase3.png"><img src="PackageLayoutPhase3.png" width=600 border=0></img></a><p>
		

		<h3>Major Additions and Changes to Classes</h3>
		
		<p><b>Network Classes</b></p>
		<p>Server classes</p>
		<ul>
			<li>SuperCECServer: This class represents our server. It encapsulates and hides the complexity for handling
			sockets, and input/output streams. Upon launch, it submits three main tasks to a thread pool which it also
			encapsulates (ExecutorService). 
				<ul>
					<li><b>ServerClientAcceptor</b>: this task is responsible for listening on the Server Socket which the 
					server instantiates. Each time a client connects, it spawns a new task: ServerThreadPerClient. 
					This task handles each individual client connection to the server - socket, streams, email address,
					sending/receiving from the server to the target client. </li>
					<li><b>EmailListenerCECServer</b>: the ServerThreadPerClient task puts emails which it receives on a 
					a LinkedBlockingDeque owned by the SuperCECServer. This shared data is concurrently accessed by 
					the EmailListenerCECServer task which takes care of getting the right output stream and sending
					that email to the target recipient. </li>
					<li><b>SendPendingMessages</b>: in the event that a user had registered with the server, and is now
					currently offline and receives an email, this thread is tasked with trying to send all un-received
					emails to that person upon his reconnection. It is triggered from the ServerClientAcceptor.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
			<li>All data structures owned by the SuperCECServer used to manage the concurrency. It was smarter to create
			new thread-safe library-managed collections and then use the ExecutorService than trying to hand-code the 
			wait/notify or even more low-level lock/unlock. We might be able to squash some of these
			collections together by merging some objects; however, we don't have a compelling reason yet. <br><br>
				<img src="SuperCECServerDataStructures.png" border=0></img><br><br>
				
			</li>
			
			<li>The Server main() code is very simple as shown here: <br><br>
				<img src="SuperCECServerMainMethod.png" border=0></img><br><br>
			</li>
			
			<li> The handshake between the client and the server looks something like this (used http://www.websequencediagrams.com/): 
			<br><br>
			<img src="handshake.png"></img><br></li>
		
		</ul>		
		<p>The overall set of classes which communicate on the server side are shown here:</p>
		<p><a href="networkserverclasses.png"><img src="networkserverclasses.png" width=800 border=0></img></a></p>
		
		<p>Client Network Classes</p>
		<ul>
			<li>NetworkHelper: used to initially connect to the server (see handshake sequence diagram above). Its other
			responsibilities are to send emails, meeting requests, and meeting updates. It manages its own local thread
			pool, on which it adds the task to listen for messages from server.  </li>
			<li>ListenerForMessagesFromServer: the server can send different types of objects - emails, acknowledgement 
			of receiving something, and meeting change sets. This task is responsible for listening and responding 
			correctly to each of the kinds of objects it can receive. </li>
			<li><a href="networkclientclasses.png"><img src="networkclientclasses.png" border=0></img></a><br></li>
		</ul>
		<br><br>
		
		<p>Communication Change Set (CCS)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The CCS was used to communicate differences to the server when a client updated a meeting after it had already
			been sent and received by the server.</li>
			<li>A <b>Change </b>object contains the before and after values for a field. Each change the user makes is stored
			in a CCS object as shown below. The CCS can take one one of a few states (ACCEPT, DECLINE, CHANGE, CHANGE_ACCEPTED,
			and CHANGE_REJECTED). These states were used to communicate between client and server on the type of operation
			which was being sent. </li>
			<li>This change set was the main form of communication between client and server to enable two clients to 
			simultaneously edit an appointment over the network, and relied on a few system invariants (mostly discussed 
			below), such as the fact that the meeting after being sent is OWNED by the server.  <br><br></li>

		<h2>Important Decisions</h2>
		
		
		<h3>Decision Name</h3>
		<p>Problem: ?</p>
		<p>Solution: ?</p>  
		
	
		
				
		<h2>Reused Libraries / Code Inspiration (in addition to Phase 1)</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>StringTokenizer: Tokenizer to help with removing spaces and email address parsing
			(java.util.StringTokenizer)</li>
			<li>SrtringUtils: Apache Commons Language StringUtils to help with counting the number 
			of occurrences of a certain character within a string (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils)</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h2>Design Patterns (extensions and applications from Phase 1)</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Builder: cec.model.EmailBuilder, cec.model.MeetingBuilder</li>
			<li>Factory: cec.model.FolderFactory, cec.persistence.EmailDaoFactory, 
			cec.persistence.FolderDaoFactory, cec.model.RuleSetFactory, cec.persistence.RuleDaoFactory,
			cec.persistence.MeetingDaoFactory, cec.persistence.TemplateDaoFactory  </li>
			<li>Adapter/Wrapper: cec.view.Email, cec.view.EmailClient</li>
			<li>Facade: cec.persistence.EmailXMLDao, cec.persistence.FolderXMLDao (for the javax.xml.parser,
			javax.xml.transform, apache.commons.io, and w3c.dom classes)</li>
			<li>Observer: cec.view.EmailClient (TreeSelectionListener), JTable for emails listens to 
			model changes when an email is send, saved, or deleted., all JTextComponents on which InputMaps
			and ActionMaps were defined.  
			</li>
			<li>Singleton: cec.view.EmailClient</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>OOD Honorable Mentions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Value object: cec.view.EmailViewEntity</li>
			<li>Data Access Object (DAO) interfaces: cec.persistence.EmailDao, cec.persistence.FolderDao</li>
			<li>Test Patterns: 
				<ul>
					<li>Stub objects: isolated model tests by injecting/stubbing dependencies to persistence</li>
					<li>Integration: a few more-involved integration tests were written, on the back
					bone one solid unit tests</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
