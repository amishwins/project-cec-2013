		<h2>Architecture and Design</h2>
		
		<p>Phase 2 presented us with some new requirements to complement our already <b><i>robust</i></b> 
		email client:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Email Template
				<ul>
					<li>Create Template</li>
					<li>Edit Template</li>
					<li>Delete Template</li>
					<li>Apply Template</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Search emails in Inbox (and its subfolders)</li>
			<li>Email Rule Filters - move email into a specified Inbox subfolder based on certain criteria
			<ul>
					<li>Create Filter</li>
					<li>Edit Filter</li>
					<li>Delete Filter</li>
					<li>Activate/Deactivate Filter</li>
					<li>Re-order Filter</li>
					<li>Simulate Filter Execution</li>
				</ul>			
			</li>
			<li>Meetings
			<ul>
					<li>Create Meeting</li>
					<li>Edit Meeting</li>
					<li>Delete Meeting</li>
					<li>Automatic email sending</li>
				</ul>			
			</li>
		</ol>
		
	
		
		<h3>N-Tiers and Package Structure</h3>		
		<p>The package structure stayed the same. Classes were simply added to each tier</p>
		<p><a href="PackageLayout.jpg"><img src="PackageLayout.jpg" width=600 border=0></img></a><p>
		

		<h3>Major Additions and Changes to Classes</h3>
		
		<p><b>Email Template</b></p>
		<p>The Email template class diagram is shown here. It is interesting to note that we have followed
		the same n-tier architecture as originally created. EmailFrame in the context
		of a Template (NEW, EDIT, APPLY) will know to call the correct service layer methods when
		actions are performed. Model layer classes to store templates and the collection of templates are
		provided, and they communicate with the persistence layer abstraction TemplateDao.</p>		
		<p><a href="TemplatesClasses.png"><img src="TemplatesClasses.png" width=600 border=0></img></a></p>
		
		<p><b>Search Emails</b></p>		
		<p>Email interface was enhanced to implement a new Searchable interface. This allowed our application
		to treat emails as searchable, and thus call the "isMatch" method on them. The email delegated the 
		responsibility to a new Search object which used regex to determine if there is a match. This separation
		of concerns and nice encapsulation allowed us to fully unit test the search feature <b>(38 JUnit tests!)</b> in
		isolation. The JTable object in the EmailClient main application was updated with the results,
		and users could then double click to open up a found email.</p>		
		<p><a href="SearchClasses.png"><img src="SearchClasses.png" width=600 border=0></img></a></p>

		<p><b>Rule Filters</b></p>		
		<p>Rule Filters, just like Templates and Meetings required us to build objects in each layer of our
		n-tier architecture. The communication between layers was respected, and we used View Entity objects
		to ensure that there was no direct coupling. RuleFrame is responsible to handle the new and edit 
		functionality. RuleSettings is responsible to help the user organize all rules by having them
		visible all in one place, and given the ability to re-order them.  </p>
		<p>In order to realize the function of ordered rules, we decided to use a separate XML file to
		store the value of the latest rule. This allowed us to easily "query" for the next rule ID. Swap
		was enabled so that users could change the order of rules, and therefore influence how their
		emails would be affected when rules were executed.

		<p><b>Meetings</b></p>		
		<p>Meetings constructed as first-class citizens in our overall design - they are given their
		own independent UI, service, model and persistence objects, and the existing Folder architecture
		was adapted to handle displaying and manipulation of meetings. We needed to consider the operations
		such as create, edit, and cancel/delete. One thing we noticed was that the meeting view entity
		was quite large, and that perhaps we could encapsulate sub-features into their own objects
		(for example MeetingDates). <i>This will be left as an exercise to the reader.</i> </p>

		<h2>Important Decisions</h2>
		
		
		<h3>Template and Email Sharing Same View Class (EmailFrame)</h3>
		<p>Problem: Template view looks almost exactly the same as Email view</p>
		<p>Our design has Template reuse the same view class <code>EmailFrame</code>. This at first seemed
		like a good idea since Templates and Emails are very similar; however, towards the end of phase 2, 
		it became troublesome. In the end, we decided to live with this violation of SRP (EmailFrame can 
		be instantiated for both Emails and Template), because the benefit of reduced duplication outweighed
		the other considerations.</p>  
		
		<h3>Changes to the Folder Model Classes to Support Meetings</h3>
		<p>Problem: how to support Meeting Objects and the fact that they need to be displayed in a folder 
		in the UI.</p>
		<p>Originally, Folder was an abstract class, with two children SystemFolder and UserFolder (to represent
		the different folders in our hierarchy of folders). Each Folder know about its contents - a generic 
		collection of &lt;Email&gt;. With the introduction of Meetings, we needed to think long and hard about
		how to handle these new objects, since they too needed to be represented in some sort of containing 
		folder. Our solution looked like this:</p>
		
		<p><img src="FolderStrategy.png"></img></p>
		
		<p>Essentially, we needed to push down SystemFolder and UserFolder in the inheritance hierarchy so that
		we could treat Folders containing Meetings and Folders containing Emails similarly. However, even this 
		solution (being as clean as it was), still led to some headaches and "conditional logic" in our EmailClient
		main view class. Additionally, MeetingFolder and UserFolder shared some mutually exclusive methods, and
		we were forced to throw exceptions in the event that they were incorrectly called.  
		
		<h3>Search and Special Characters</h3>
		<h3>Applying Template - Getting the UI to Highlight</h3>
		<p>Problem: how to support a nice flow of guided template usage so the user is delighted</p>
		<p>This was a challenging endeavour. We first tried to manually parse the fields in a template, and build
		some sort of map of placeholders. This, coupled with the complexities of handling replacements in the text
		and responding to keyboard events resulted in quite a big headache. Eventually, after some research into
		using JTextArea and JTextFields, we decided that using javax.swing.InputMap and javax.swing.ActionMap was
		the best approach, and hid complexities in well encapsulated objects.</p>
		<p>For the regex part, we designed an implemented a Placeholder Helper class, whose responsibility was to
		respond with the current start and end positions of the next available placeholder match. </p>
		<p><img src="phh.png"/></p>
		<p>Each field on which we wanted to apply the highlighting mechanism was asked to return its Input Map and
		Action Map.	From there, we registered an input (in our case, either the Enter key, or the Tab key), and
		corresponding Action (in our case, to run an Abstract Action which we aptly named CommitAction). Commit
		Action took as input the field for which the input was performed, and then executed a simple method (action
		performed was called by the swing framework upon detection of the input):</p>
		
		<p><img src="commitactioncode.png"/></p>
		
		<p>Much of the complexity of dealing with the regex and positions was hidden nicely in the Placeholder Helper
		class. This allowed us to fully test some of the edge and corner cases before actually using the methods.</p>
		 
		
		<h3>Rules - How to Treat Creation, Activation, and Execution</h3>
		<p>Problem: dealing with single rules, multiple rules, and overlapping rules</p>
		<p>Our approach here was to make the application of rules as simple as possible. From the very beginning,
		we designed rules to work with the following constraints:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A single rule could trigger on either email addresses of the sender (semicolon-separated),
			and/or target words (space-separate)</li>
			<li>A single rule can have both email addresses and words to trigger on, but not neither. </li>
			<li>Rules are triggered on all emails in the inbox.</li>
			<li>If a single rule is applied, it loops over each email in the inbox and checks if the email
			fits the rule criteria. If it does, it moves the email to the target specified in the rule</li>
			<li>When all rules are applied, the order of execution is as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>For each emails</li>
					<li>- For each rule </li>
					<li>- - If rule applies to email, move email and then break. If not, then continue to the next rule</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Rules can be reordered. The order they appear in is the order in which they are executed.</li>
		</ul>
	
		
				
		<h2>Reused Libraries / Code Inspiration (in addition to Phase 1)</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>javax.swing.InputMap and javax.swing.ActionMap - to handle the behavior when the user
			applied a template to a new email</li>
			<li>javax.swing.Timer to handle the periodic simulation of receiving an email, and firing the
			rules afterwards</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h2>Design Patterns (extensions and applications from Phase 1)</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Builder: cec.model.EmailBuilder, cec.model.MeetingBuilder</li>
			<li>Factory: cec.model.FolderFactory, cec.persistence.EmailDaoFactory, 
			cec.persistence.FolderDaoFactory, cec.model.RuleSetFactory, cec.persistence.RuleDaoFactory,
			cec.persistence.MeetingDaoFactory, cec.persistence.TemplateDaoFactory  </li>
			<li>Adapter/Wrapper: cec.view.Email, cec.view.EmailClient</li>
			<li>Facade: cec.persistence.EmailXMLDao, cec.persistence.FolderXMLDao (for the javax.xml.parser,
			javax.xml.transform, apache.commons.io, and w3c.dom classes)</li>
			<li>Observer: cec.view.EmailClient (TreeSelectionListener), JTable for emails listens to 
			model changes when an email is send, saved, or deleted., all JTextComponents on which InputMaps
			and ActionMaps were defined.  
			</li>
			<li>Singleton: cec.view.EmailClient</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>OOD Honorable Mentions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Value object: cec.view.EmailViewEntity</li>
			<li>Data Access Object (DAO) interfaces: cec.persistence.EmailDao, cec.persistence.FolderDao</li>
			<li>Test Patterns: 
				<ul>
					<li>Stub objects: isolated model tests by injecting/stubbing dependencies to persistence</li>
					<li>Integration: a few more-involved integration tests were written, on the back
					bone one solid unit tests</li>
				</ul>
			</li>	
		
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Known Issues</h2>
		<h3>Overwrite Template</h3>
		<p>Currently our save policy does not check if saving a template with the same name will overwrite 
		an existing template with the same name. This is 
		
		<h3>Closing the rule edit window using the X button</h3>
		<p>If the user opens the Rule Settings window, and proceeds to edit one rule, but then decides to 
		cancel the operation, the UI will still show that the rule is selected on the JTable. But if the 
		user decides to click Edit again, he is in for quite a surprise! The system responds with "Please 
		select a rule to edit." 
		
		<h3>Use a Test Helper for the RuleSetIntegration tests</h3>
		<p>We wanted to try and use a Test Helper for some of the integration tests to handle some of the
		heavy lifting, and hide away some complexity from the test class itself. This was not completed in
		time.</p>
		
		<h3>Some TODOs left in the code</h3>
		<p>We were unable to cleanup every single TODO left in the code. This is something which we should 
		target before beginning the implementation task for Phase 3.</p>
