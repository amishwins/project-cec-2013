#summary List of things we still need to do!

= Document Issues we Find (todos, etc.) =

== UI ==

  * Look and Feel for JTree of Folders
  * Headings for JTable are different in Inbox (From, Subject, Time), and Drafts (To, Subject, Time)
  * Should we sort the inbox and drafts differently? We should sort all folders?


== Model ==

  * Finalize interfaces
  * Unit tests
  * {{{EmailImpl}}} currently checks if the date field LastModifiedDate is empty. If not, we get a runtime exception. But this might be the wrong approach. We basically cannot allow this field to ever be empty. It's an invariant! The sorting depends on it.

== Persistence ==

  * Unit tests ?
  * If you hit "enter" a few times while composing an email, the system inserts "\n" within the text. In the XML file however, it's stored simply as space (new lines). How can we preserve that when we convert the XML back to a string to display in the UI?

== Cross-cutting Concerns ==

  * The fields for EACH LAYER need to be well established and documented
