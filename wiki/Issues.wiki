== UI ==

  * Look and Feel for JTree of Folders
  * Headings for JTable are different in Inbox (From, Subject, Time), and Drafts (To, Subject, Time)
  * Should we sort the inbox and drafts differently? We should sort all folders?


== Model ==

  * Finalize interfaces
  * Unit tests

== Persistence ==

  * Unit tests ?

== Cross-cutting Concerns ==

  * The fields for EACH LAYER need to be well established and documented
